## Extended Waves

## Fibbonnacci extension
- used to find the end of the 3rd and 4th corrective waves and the end of the 3rd & 5th impulsive wave.

### Impulsive Fibbonacci

### Corrective Fibbonacci
- find end of corrective move

### Fibbonacci levels
- tell us when we can enter the market
- second corrective wave usually pulls back to 25.6% - 100%
- You measure your corrective wave by measurning the previous impulsive wave
- So if you want to measure your second corrective wave, you need to measure the 1st wave.
- So if you want to measure your 4th corrective wave, you need to measure the 2st wave.

- Measure impulsive wave, by measurning the prvious correive wave.
- So id you want to measure the 3rd impulsive wave, you measure the 1st wave.

- In uptrends, we measure our impulses form the very bottom to the very top
- In downtrends, we measure our impulsive waves form the very top to the very bottom.
- We always measure it in the direction of the trend.

### Second corrective wave
- 50% - 61.8% are the most strongest levels of correctrion for the second wave
- the shorter the second wave (hits less than 50% retracal), the stronger the 3rd wave

### Third corrective wave
- Get by measuring 1st impulsive wave
- Usually hits 161.8% of the 1st wave

### Forth corrective wave
- Get by measuring 3rdst impulsive wave
- Usually hits usually hits up to 50% of the 3rd wave, it doesn't usually pull back more
- 38.2% - 50.0% usually pull back to the 3rd wave

### Fith corrective wave
- Doesn't have any set levels

### We trade with the trend
- if it breaks the trand, it'ss go in the opposite direction.
- trade 2% risk for

💡 RULES FOR USING TRADE IDEAS ON MY SESSIONS 💡

1️⃣ RISK PER TRADE / LOT SIZE

Open orders on the 2-4% risk per trade maximum. It means that on every single trade you risk from 2% to 4% of your whole account size.

🧮 HOW TO CALCULATE LOT SIZE AND RISK

⤵️ What you need to know:
- How much is your risk in %
- How much is your risk in cash
- How many pips do you have to Stop Loss

Example:
You have 1000$ deposit in your account.
You decide you will be risking 3% of your account size on every single trade you take.

3% of 1000% is 30$

You have 50 pips SL in this order.

↪️ FORMULA FOR LOT SIZE CALCULATION (for currency pairs mainly)
Risk in cash / the amount of pips to Stop Loss / 10

So your LOT SIZE is: 30/50/10 = 0.06

2️⃣ HOW TO MANAGE THE ORDER

2.1 For currency pairs:

Every time you are up 25-30 pips in profit, you move your Stop Loss to Break Even (BE, entry price)

2.2 For indices, cryptocurrency, gold, USOIL and exotic pairs like USDHUF and USDMXN

Every time you are up 50 pips in profit, you move your Stop Loss to Break Even (BE, entry price)

3️⃣ MANAGING THE OPENED ORDERS

3.1 Do not double or triple your orders. Do not open a few same orders in a row. We do not want to risk more than we need to.

3.2 If you see Take Profit 1, Take Profit 2 and Take Profit 3, you still do not open 2 or 3 orders. Open one order and put the price of the Take Profit 1.

3.3 When the price is close to TP1, move your TP to TP2. You can modify your your order in MT4. At the same time move your SL in profit

3.4 If the order closed on TP1 and you didn’t move it to TP2, do not open another order. Just take a profit you’ve got. If you open another order after the price made a move, you take a risk of getting stoped while the price does the retest.

4️⃣ TRADING INDICES, GOLD, USOIL, CRYPTOCURRENCY AND EXOTIC PAIRS (like USDHUF, USDMXN)

Trade on this instruments only if you have >500$ account size.
