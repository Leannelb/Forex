## T.E. Lawrence
Laurence of Arabia, watch the film
```
All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.
```

### THREE ESSENTIAL QS
1. What my life has been upto to this point
2. What would I truely love my life to be like
3. Am i open enough & committed enough to follow direction and make whatever changes my new mindset requires?

### The essesce of me is:
- All knowing
- all powerful
- ever present
- !!!! This is what my spirit brings me

### The Spirit
- Is made up of a vibration. We have accesss to this vibration

### Ideas become your mindset
- IF you hold that idea, it HAS to come to fruition

### Concious mind
#### You can accept or reject any thought that comes into your mind, just don't give a thought
#### Only think about the things that will push you forward
#### That cause you to mive into a better vibration
#### We have the power to originate ideas

### Subconcious mind
#### Your subconcious mind cannot differentiate between things youve imagined or real
#### Cannot reject, Can only accept
#### What you plant here is what will grow into results.
